# The FreeNotion Project

FreeNotion is a software project that allows you to use Notion locally as a notepad.

Obsidian, a markdown editor, is good enough, but the markdown grammar is not as intuitive as general commercial document writing software, as it requires the use of HTML grammar.</br>
So in this project, we develop software that easily uses the grammar of the successful commercial software Notion to write documents and other functions, and parses the functions to operate with standard technologies such as markdown and JavaScript.
